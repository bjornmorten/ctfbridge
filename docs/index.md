# CTFBridge

CTFBridge is a Python library that standardizes interaction with Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms like CTFd, rCTF, and HTB — so you can focus on solving challenges, not reverse-engineering APIs.

Use a single, consistent API to:

- 🧩 Fetch challenges and metadata
- 🚩 Submit flags
- 🏆 Access scoreboards
- 🔐 Manage sessions and authentication

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Unified API for multiple CTF platforms — one interface, no per-platform hacks
- 🧩 Easy to extend with your own platform clients and parsers
- 📦 Challenge enrichment (authors, services, attachments) included out of the box
- 🔒 Clean authentication flow (supports credentials and API tokens)
- ⚙️ Platform auto-detection from just a URL — no config required
- 🔄 Session save/load support for persistent sessions
- 🤖 Designed for automation and scripting (async-first)
